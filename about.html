   <h4>Hi ya'll, im Katie!</h4>
   <p> I’m a 20 something, free spirit living my best life in Chattanooga Tennessee’s gorgeous Southside! So, about me… I enjoy making beautiful things, to put it simply. From interior design with a mid-century touch, to vector illustrations, to UI design I find it fun to put together little things, and make a gorgeous peice for the eyes!
   I think the love of design came as a young (sweet) girl making a profile on Myspace. I designing profile layouts for my friends and I. Fast forward a few years later and my little hometown has become quite the home for startups. With many friends as developers, I realized this was something I was really interested in, along with the design side. I decided a mentorship focused on user experience design and fronted development was a perfect fit for me.</p>
