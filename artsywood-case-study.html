 <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
</div>
   <div class="comp-talk">
     <p>With more and more companies selling their goods online, you can beat the hustle and bustle of running store to store. The three companies I looked at were <strong>West Elm</strong>, who has many store fronts across the country and also sells a large precent of their merchandise. West Elm was amazing for filtering through items by many different criteria. <strong>ATGcustom</strong>, who sells custom high end furniture online without a store did well in filtering through their different options for wood type and finishes for their custom furniture. <strong>Hazel & Olive</strong>, a online clothing boutique that has a small storefront, and sells most of their items online did a great job with displaying their newest items.</p>

 <h7><i>What I learned, and brought to Artsywood</i></h7>
 <p>What is most important to people is time, so having a checkout process that included signing up as a new customer, checkout as a guest, or sign in as a returning customer was important for a easy checkout experience. Having new items displayed made sure that no one would miss anything and take you straight you where you needed to be.</p>

 <h2>USER STORIES</h2>

  <p>I wrote user stories and flows that I then put into <strong>Draw.io</strong> and created a few diagrams that I could easily  refer back to in the design process.</p>

 <h2>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h2>
 <div class="low-fi-info">
   <p>I created low-fidelity wireframes in <strong>Balsamiq</strong> that were useful displaying how I was going to lay out each element to have a seamless flow throughout the webpage, which helped me in seeing what needed to be displayed on each page, and then desiging around that</p>

 <h2>DESIGN ELEMENTS & TYPE</h2>
 <div class="elements-and-type-info">
   <p>Keeping the theme of the mid-century 50’s and 60’s style of the Artsywood I made sure to add simple design features to bring out that era. I designed from scratch the classic mid-century star and “wallpaper” elements to add a unique focus points to the page. The type included the Zing script for the products heading to capture the charm into each products description, Esplanade Script for the logo transferred you right into the fun side of modernism, and Bangla Sangam MN for a crisp typeface to keep clean lines. We focused utilizing white space for the webpage as well as using classic mid-century colors of teal, gold, and gray with pops of saturated orange.</p>

 <h2>PROTOTYPE & USER TESTING</h2>
 <div class="prototype-and-user-testing-info">
   <p>I then created a working prototype using <strong>Invision</strong> that I used to survey and test users for feedback on design, function & usability. From these results I gathered feedback via Google Doc surveys and I then shared the survey and prototype to test users in person as well as over Skype. I watched and listened to them talk aloud as they went through the prototype and conducted an interview during the user testing process. Useful features came out of the user testing, like for the future development of the webpage to have product details appear when hovered over, instead of pop down menus.</p>

 <h3>THE</h3>
 <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
 <div class="conclusion-info">
   <p>This project was eye opening into the world of e-commerce design and all the features that make having a easy shopping experience come to life. Prototyping in person is something I’ve grown to find has the best results, you can see how each person reacts immediately to the project which in return helps me understand and see more clearly where the user is coming from when they give their feedback</p>
